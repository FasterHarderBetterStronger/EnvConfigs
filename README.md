As a heavy CLI User, there are many surprising things that can be improved without modifying the Terminal Emulator layer that make large impacts in the amount of information that can be grokked from a brief glance at a Term (Aside from fixing the contrast. Green on Black saves vision and prevents personal eye fatigue).
* Eliminate the need for Title Exchanges or other junk that doesn't work correctly in full screen mode, or over some types of remote connections.
* Configurations make different CLI applications more useful on cursory output glances. 
* Editor configurations add tons of functionality at a lower cost than the Window Decor of a GUI. 
* More will be added such as links to dependancies, lists of dependancies, et cetera.

That manner of crap is this repo's Mode Operandii. Also - Use at your own risk, this is licences with an "I don't give a fuck what you do moron, this is a repos for me anyway. If you wind up hosing your shit, that's on you, It sure as fuck ain't my fault.

/NOTE/ While not FORBIDDEN by the license, If you're using this within the capacity of the Government of The United States - I HOPE this fucks your shit up and renders it unusable you facist, treasonous, criminals. Too bad I'm disallowed to MANDATE viewing of the drawing + quartering of EVERY LAST ONE OF YOU to the entire population, maybe then you'd learn that BRIBES ARE NOT SPEECH!
